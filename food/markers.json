Participants must bring an ID with an address. No referral or pre-registration is required for this program. If picking up for someone else, you must have a current proxy on file. \n \nThird, the Senior Supplemental Food Program helps improve the health of elderly citizens through supplemental and nutritious food boxes. Participants must meet income guidelines and be pre-registered for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (learn more at https://jfs.ohio.gov/cash-food-and-refugee-assistance/food-assistance/food-programs/commodity-supplemental-food-program). \n \nFourth, the Blessing Box is an outdoor pantry box stocked with non-perishable sacked meals for those in need of emergency assistance after-hours when the Emergency Food Pantry is closed. \n \nIn addition to those food pantries, Open M’s Grab & Go Lunch provides fresh, healthy meals to the community during the last two weeks of each month. It is provided in partnership with churches, organizations, and community groups who purchase, prepare, and serve each meal. \n \nOpen M also offers services in the Work, Financial, & Legal Support and  Medical Care categories.",
